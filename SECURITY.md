# Security  

If you discover a significant vulnerability, please report it privately to ensure a responsible disclosure process.  

We recommend using GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting mechanism](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
To submit a report:  

1. Visit the parent [repositoryâ€™s Security tab](https://github.com/soumeh01/cmsis-toolbox/security).  
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"** to open the advisory form.  

Your responsible disclosure helps maintain the security and integrity of the project. Thank you for your contribution!
